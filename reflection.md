-what was the hardest part of the project?
-getting the targetting to work was the toughest. Figuring out what enemy to shoot and if that enemy is in range was challenging. there were always errors or it would shoot at the wrong enemy or wouldnt shoot at all. another thing that was hard was just learning p5.play and how it worked. the documentation for it wasnt the best and made it sorta difficult to understand. in the end it reallly benefitted my project. making it so the towers couldnt be placed on the paths was very difficult. i never got it working but spent lots of time on it. the way that colliders in p5.play work made it hard. 

- did you complete all of your needs to have list
-no, i didnt get the upgrade shop working. i ran out of time and also felt that it wouldnt add much to the game. i also didnt get sound working. i just ran out of time for that one.

-what are you most proud of?
-the targetting, it works almost all of the time and shoots the correct enemy. getting this correct was very important to the game as it is the main thing. im alos proud of the smoothness of the game. it all works and is easy to understand although i do wish i got sprites working.
